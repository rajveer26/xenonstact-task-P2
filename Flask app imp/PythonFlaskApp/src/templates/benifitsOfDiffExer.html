        <h1>Benefits of Different Exercises</h1>
        <mark>Most people tend to focus on one type of exercise or activity and think they’re doing enough. Research has shown that it’s important to get all four types of exercise: endurance, strength, balance, and flexibility. Each one has different benefits. Doing one kind also can improve your ability to do the others, and variety helps reduce boredom and risk of injury. No matter your age, you can find activities that meet your fitness level and needs!</mark><br>
           <br><h5>Endurance exercises for older adults</h5>
Endurance activities, often referred to as aerobic, increase your breathing and heart rates. These activities help keep you healthy, improve your fitness, and help you perform the tasks you need to do every day. Endurance exercises improve the health of your heart, lungs, and circulatory system. They also can delay or prevent many diseases that are common in older adults such as diabetes, colon and breast cancers, heart disease, and others.
           <br>
           <br><mark>Physical activities that build endurance include:</mark>

<br>->Brisk walking or jogging
<br>->Yard work (mowing, raking)
<br>->Dancing
<br>->Swimming
<br>->Biking
<br>->Climbing stairs or hills
<br>->Playing tennis or basketball<br>

      <br>When you adopt a healthy lifestyle, you provide a more positive role model for other people in your family, particularly children. You will also create a better environment for them to grow up in. By helping them to follow a healthier lifestyle, you will be contributing to their wellbeing and enjoyment of life now and in the future<br>

<br>Managing stress in positive ways, instead of through smoking or drinking alcohol, reduces wear and tear on your body at the molecular level. For a longer and more comfortable life, you should adopt a healthy life style.<br>
